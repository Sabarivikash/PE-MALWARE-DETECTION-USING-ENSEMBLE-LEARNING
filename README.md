# PE-MALWARE-DETECTION-USING-ENSEMBLE-LEARNING

In the ever rising age of the internet, where security breaches have become very common the
safety of users have been put on threat. This is majorly observed to be done through evolving
viruses. One such virus is known as a malware; which was initially detected in 1970 and has
witnessed to grow exponentially. Therefore this creates a challenging task in the digital
environment with respect to complexity and volume; leading to loss of information and
replacement of malicious codes. Also, with existing traditional methods which are mostly
time consuming and unreliable, it becomes quite easy for malware creators to get away with
it. Hence, with this purpose, comes the need to develop intelligent and automatic detection
techniques that could not only detect but also classify malwares as, good-ware and benign.
Hence, I propose the implementation of Machine Learning based hybrid ensemble algorithms
that could discover portable executable files by examining their static features. Furthermore, I
modify our original model to enrich the extractable information, by implementing on a
dataset whose content range from unambiguous malware and good-ware samples to more
ambiguous and real ones. A total of four ML based algorithms, one stacking algorithm and
two deep learning algorithms are trained and tested on this dataset, with stacking algorithms
achieving the highest accuracy of 99.20 percent. Selecting the number of features was based
on research of previous studies. This thesis confirms that it is possible to use machine
learning for static malware detection. It can also help for future automated malware analysis
research.
